<h1>An Interesting Property of Parabolas</h1>
</div>
<p>Parabolas have an interesting property. A parabola of the form $x(x-a)$ is just $x^2$ shifted along the graph of $-x^2$ by a horizontal distance of $-\frac{a}{2}$. </p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>A parabola in factored form $x(x-a)$ has its roots at $x = 0$ and $x=a$. The vertex is halfway between, at $x = \frac{a}{2}$. This means the vertex is at $y = -(\frac{a}{2})^2$, since the root is $(\frac{a}{2})^2$ higher than the vertex. This naturally follows the graph of $y=-x^2$.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it is rather simple, it is still interesting that the vestiges of other equations show up in unexpected places.</p>
