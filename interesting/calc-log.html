<h1>An Algorithm for Calculating Logarithms</h1>

<p>Logarithms are an often-used mathematical function, so naturally there should be a way to calculate them. On the Math Stack Exchange, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/820094/what-is-the-best-way-to-calculate-log-without-a-calculator">User Ezui described an algorithm he created</a> (which has been used for a while) for calculating arbitrary logarithms, analogous to long division. This article describes the steps of that algorithm and improves it.</p>

<p>All variables apply only to their section unless otherwise noted.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>The following are the steps to calculate $\log_{a}{(b)}$. Define $n$ as the solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the greatest power of $a$ less than or equal to $b$, and call it $c$. Define $d = \log_{a}{(c)}$. $n = d.???$.</li>
<li>Find $e = \frac{b}{c}$.</li>
<li>Find $e^{10} = f$.</li>
<li>Recursively do steps 1-3 on $f$ but put the next $d$ on the next decimal place. Repeat until you have your desired precision. If ever $e = 1$, your answer is exact.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>The algorithm uses the principle that $$\log_{x}{(yz)} = \log_{x}{y} + \log_{x}{z}$$ and $$\log_{x}{(y^z)} = z\log_{x}{y}$$ For this proof, use the definitions from the steps. $c \le b$, so $\log_{a}{c}$ is part of the solution. After dividing and getting $e$, taking $e^{10}$ is necessary to avoid a decimal logarithm. With $e^{10}$, the decimal logarithm is multiplied by 10, which guarantees an integer. If not, the integer will come on one of the next rounds. The only time it never comes is when $e = 1$, and in that case you have found your answer.<p>
<h2>Improving the Algorithm</h2>
<p>Initially finding the greatest $c \le b$ can take a long time when $c$ and $b$ are far apart. To cut down this time is possible, however. Apply the definitions from the steps here.</p>

<ol>
<li>See how many non-leading digits are in $a$ and $b$, and take whatever root of $b$ makes sense (call this the $h$th root)</li>
<li>Do the algorithm on $\sqrt[h]{b}$</li>
<li>Take the resulting $d$, so that $d_{final} = dh$</li>
</ol>

<p>When choosing $h$, make it close to the $b:a$ ratio of non-leading digits, and consider the result of raising $a$'s leading digit to $h$ (would $a^h \ge b$?). Take the resulting $e^h$ and continue the algorithm on that, using it as $f$ (add the next $d$ as-is to the result, as a whole number). It is fine if taking $\sqrt[h]{b}$ does not remove the entire whole-number part of the logarithm, as you can simply repeat the process and add each result to the answer. Should it cut into the decimal part of the logarithm, you can still continue normally; just remember to add any results in the appropriate decimal position. The whole number part of the logarithm ends at $\sqrt[h]{b} = a^1$, the tenths at $a^{\frac{1}{10}}$, and so on, so you can tell which place you've cut into and act appropriately.</p>


<p>For example, take $\log_{20}{4155}$. To repeatedly multiply by 2 would be rather tedious, so instead notice that $4155$ has 3 times as many non-leading digits as 20. Also notice that $2^3 = 8$ ($2$ as it is $20$'s leading digit) meaning the answer's leading digit is probably 2. Take $\sqrt[2]{4155} \approx 64.459$. Now it is easy: since $\log_{20}{64.459} = 1.???$, $\log_{20}{4155} = 2.???$. $\frac{4155}{20^2} < 2$, so the rest of the algorithm deals with the decimal part of the logarithm. Continue solving for answer $\approx 2.7813$.</p>

<p>This works because $\log_{x}{(y^n)} = n\log_{x}{y}$, and taking the $n$th root is just raising to the $1/n$th power. To take arbitrary roots is possible, and here you are not locked into multiples of 10 because that only matters for the decimal representation. Adding numbers can be done in any base.</p>

<h2>An Even Simpler Improvement</h2>
<p>An even simpler method exists. Use the principle that $$\log_{x}{y} = \frac{\log_{z}{y}}{\log_{z}{x}}$$ where $z$ is an arbitrary number. Apply the definitions from the steps. For $\log_{a}{b}$, turn it into the quotient of base-10 logarithms: $$\log_{a}{b} = \frac{\log_{10}{b}}{\log_{10}{a}}$$ Now do the algorithm separately on both terms. Since the individual logs are base-10, $d$ is just the number of non-leading digits. Continue the algorithm appropriately. Now divide numerator by denominator, and you have your final answer!</p>

<p>This is much faster but can be less precise since any precision issues in the fraction will be amplified when you divide to convert the fraction into a decimal. You could simply calculate the base-10 logs to at least twice as many decimal places as you want your base-a log to be, circumventing the precision issue.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This algorithm is extremely useful for calculating logarithms. It is easy to understand and is a systematic way of calculating them, similar to long division, addition algorithms, and the like.</p>
