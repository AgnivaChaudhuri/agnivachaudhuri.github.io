<h1>A discovery about parabolas</h1>
<p>I recently discovered something very interesting about parabolas. When you add stuff to a parabola, you can see "shadows" of other parabolas and graphs.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>With a parabola of form x(x-a) compared to x^2, it will slide along -x^2 with xdistance = -a/2 and ydistance = -a^2/4.</p>

<p>To prove it generally: Set -x^2 = x(x-a). -x^2 = x^2 - ax, so 0 = 2x^2 - ax. Use the quadratic formula to get x = -a/4 +- a/4, meaning one of the intersection points is the origin, and the other point is (-a/2, -a^2/4). The line x = -a/2 is the axis of symmetry, so that second intersection point must be the vertex.</p>

<p>When you take parabola x^2 and compare it to x(x-a), the vertex will horizontally travel right a/2 units along -(x^2), because the vertical distance between "vertex form involving a" and our target parabola is x(x-a) - (x-a)^2 = ax - a^2. Then to find horizontal distance, set y = ax - a^2, factor as y = a(x-a). There is only 1 vertical and 1 horizontal distance, so we can use that to solve it. Can someone who knows how to do this help me?</p>

<h2>Introduction and preliminary knowledge</h2>
<p>A parabola is the set of all points equidistant from a line (directrix) and a point (focus). They follow the general form ax^2 + bx + c where a, b, and c are arbitrary integers and c is the y-intercept. This is the standard form; another form is y = a(x-h)^2 + k where (h, k) is the vertex. They can also be in factored form, y = a(x-r1)(x-r2) where r1 and r2 are the roots, the places where it crosses the x axis. </p>
<p>Take the graph of y = x^2. You get a basic parabola where a = 1, b and c = 0. This is equivalent to y = (x)(x).</p>
<p>Now take the graph of y = (x+1)^2, or y = x^2 + 2x + 1. This graph is the same graph from above, shifted left by 1. </p>
<h2>The discovery</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Take the graph of y = x(x+1), or y = x^2 + x, and call it f(x). This graph is shifted left and down, with the vertex at (-1/2, -1/4).</p>
<p>Take the graph of y = -x^2, g(x), and superimpose the two graphs. They intersect at the vertex of f(x).</p>
<p>Define V and H as the vertical and horizontal distance between a point on one graph and the corresponding point on the other. </p>
<p>f(x) in factored form is (x-0)(x+1) so its roots are (0, 0) and (-1, 0). We can use this to find the vertical distance between f(x) and g(x).</p>
<h3>The Actiion</h3>
<p>Let's superimpose some more graphs. y = x(x+2) is h(x) and y = x(x+3) is i(x). They intersect g(x) at (-1, -1) and (-3/2, -9/4) respectively - each time, the intersection point is the vertex!</p>
<p>We can algebraically prove this. Set -x^2 = x(x-a). -x^2 = x^2 - ax, so 0 = 2x^2 - ax. By the quadratic formula, we have x = -a/4 +- a/4, meaning one of the intersection points is the origin, and the other point is (-a/2, -a^2/4).</p>
<p>We can also prove that this point is the vertex. The roots are at (-a, 0) and (0, 0). Because these are vertical parabolas, they are the same horizontal and vertical distance from the vertex, meaning the axis of symmetry is x = -a/2, which is the first coordinate.</p>
