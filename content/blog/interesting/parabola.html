<h1>An Interesting Property of Parabolas</h1>

<p>Parabolas have an interesting property. A parabola of the form $x(x-a)$ is just $x^2$ shifted along the graph of $-x^2$ by a horizontal distance of $-\frac{a}{2}$. </p>
<h2>Proof</h2>
<p>A parabola in factored form $x(x-a)$ has its roots at $x = 0$ and $x=a$. The vertex is halfway between, at $x = \frac{a}{2}$. This means the vertex is at $y = -(\frac{a}{2})^2$, since the root is $(\frac{a}{2})^2$ higher than the vertex. This naturally follows the graph of $y=-x^2$.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it is rather simple, it is still interesting that the vestiges of other equations show up in unexpected places. This can be used to prove the location of the axis of symmetry, the sum of roots, and other potentially unknown stuff.</p>
