My personal website

# Website

This is my personal Github Pages website. I put whatever I like here: scientific guides, technical guides, scientific...explosions,  my projects, stuff I develop, etc. I might eventually move it to a dedicated website.

# Purposes

The website will have stuff that's useful to people - software builds, technical advice and guides, etc. It will have a summary of my public development projects, with links to the code and releases.

You'll really need to read the website to understand what's on there since that's the easiest way to see. 

# Donate

If you're donating, thanks! You're helping me with all my experiments, inventions, and projects. 

I have Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin addresses. Bitcoin is preferred simply because most places accept it - Monero is the technologically superior one, but newer and less used. Ethereum, Litecoin...meh, nothing special. DOGE FOREVER!!!!!! (well actually not, it's just a meme, don't take "DOGE FOREVER" seriously) When donating, remember to prioritize lower fees, since it doesn't need to go through quickly and it's more important for the amount to be larger.
