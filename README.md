My personal website

# Website

This is my personal Github Pages website. I put whatever I like here, usually math, science, experiments, and art. Explore at leisure!

# Purposes

I share useful and interesting things with the world through this website, such as guides, math problems, experiments, and the like. Sometimes I work on things with my friends, and these things are on the website too (coming soon).
