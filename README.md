My personal website

# Website

This is my personal Github Pages website. I put whatever I like here, usually math, science, experiments, and art. Explore at leisure!

# Purposes

I share useful and interesting things with the world through this website, such as guides, math problems, experiments, and the like. Sometimes I work on things with my friends, and these things are on the website too.

# Donate

If you're donating, thanks! You're helping me with all my experiments, inventions, and projects. 

Addresses are below. Bitcoin is preferred because more places accept it - Monero is technologically superior, but newer and less used. Ethereum and Litecoin are nothing special. Dogecoin is...well, let's not get into that. Prioritize lower fees when donating, since it doesn't need to go through quickly and it's more important for the amount to be larger.
