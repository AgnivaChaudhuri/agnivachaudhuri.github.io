My personal website

# Website

This is my personal Github Pages website. It serves as my online portfolio detailing my work, research, projects, etc. I have a Blog section where I put whatever I like, usually math, science, experiments, and art. Explore at leisure!

# Purposes

Anyone who has an interest in my skills, employment, etc. can see my work here. I also share useful and interesting things with the world through this website, such as guides, math problems, experiments, and the like.
