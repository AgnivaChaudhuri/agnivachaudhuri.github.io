		<h1>Using fscrypt with incompatible filesystems</h1>
		<p>Fscrypt is a filesystem-based encryption library that filesystems can hook on to (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fscrypt.html). It's a finer-grained alternative to full-disk encryption, with some benefits and drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only ext4, F2FS, and UBIFS support it. Sure, we could use a stacked filesystem like eCryptFS, but that reduces performance and limits file names to 143 characters. So currently BTRFS and other common filesystems miss out on it. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNnrqyZqJ2I5nfWKt7cd1T9xwU0iHhjhk9ALQW3XuII/edit">BTRFS is planning on adding fscrypt support, though it's an early stage.</a> )</p><p></p>
		<h2>The Workaround</h2>
		<p>Luckily, there is a way to work around this! We can exploit the fact that EVERYTHING is a file. We create a file, fill it up with zeros, format it as an fscrypt-compatible filesystem, and then mount it where we want.</p><p>All the following commands generally require root. Log in as root or escalate privileges however you want, unless you do it a different way that doesn't require root.</p><p>Run:</p><p></p><p>touch \file\</p><p></p><p>where \file\ is the full path to where you want to keep the file. Maybe in /etc? Or, keep it in /tmp, especially if you'll keep important data on it! :) (but actually don't, /tmp is cleared every shutdown)</p><p></p><p>Next, run</p><p></p><p>dd if=/dev/zero of=\file\ bs=\bs\ count=\count\</p><p></p><p>where \bs\ and \count\ are arbitrary integers that multiply to your desired size. Try to make \bs\ as large as possible so dd wastes less CPU cycles switching back and forth; dd might throw an error if you make bs too large. You could also make a sparse file, though they're less reliable.</p><p></p><p>Next, run</p><p></p><p>mkfs.ext4 \file\</p><p></p><p>to format it as ext4. You could use any supported filesystem in place of ext4.</p><p></p><p>Finally, run</p><p></p><p>mount \file\ \mountpoint\</p><p></p><p>where \mountpoint\ is your desired mountpoint. If you want to encrypt your home directory, you can mount it to there. Make sure that you've backed it up so you can copy your files back.</p><p></p><p>After this, you can use fscrypt as usual. Some nice resources are <a href="https://github.com/google/fscrypt">Google's documentation</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fscrypt">the Arch wiki entry</a>.</p><p></p><p>I'll use this procedure to use fscrypt with BTRFS on Arch Linux, while I'm waiting for them to natively support it.</p><p>Side note, Fedora doesn't provide an fscrypt package, so you need to build it yourself.</p>
