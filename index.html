<h1>Agniva Chaudhuri's Website</h1> 
<p>This is my personal website. I put all sorts of stuff here like experiments, math excursions, software development and tutorials, and other fun stuff.</p>
<p>The most important thing is knowledge and information, so my website might be a little messy. I'll put a summary of each page, with direct and clear language, but below there might not be as easy to understand, simply because I am putting my ideas on the page and not giving too much thought to clarity. Don't worry, I will clean up the language if necessary.</p>
  <p>If you know something that I can add, I ask people for help, or there's anything that needs fixing, please explore <a href="https://github.com/AgnivaChaudhuri/agnivachaudhuri.github.io">the site's Github repository</a> and open an issue.</p>
